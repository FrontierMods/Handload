## Ammunition

### Types

- **JHP**: jacketed hollow point; a (usually) lead bullet covered in a thin copper jacket, with the nose of the bullet hollowed out

  - JHP rounds are designed to expand inside the body, thus causing more damage to the flesh
    - this makes them useful for hunting and self-defense
  - however, they are not as effective against body armor or cover, because they break apart rather than punch through

- **FMJ**: full metal jacket; a (usually) lead bullet covered in a thin copper jacket, except for the bottom of the bullet (the part facing the gunpowder)

  - FMJ rounds excel at penetration of body armor and cover
    - this makes them useful in military contexts, where the enemy is likely to wear body armor
  - however, they do not expand inside the wound, thus causing less damage to body tissue

- **HST**: a proprietary name for a type of JHP round produced by Federal; likely not an abbreviation, though often linked with Federal's previous popular Hydra-Shok (HS) type of JHP round

## Battlefield and Combat

- **soft cover**: an object placed between you and the attacker with the goal of reducing your visibility, thus making you harder to hit; opposite of _hard cover_

  - examples: wooden table, thin metal sheet, curtain

- **hard cover**: an object placed between you and the attacker with the goal of stopping, or at least reducing the danger of, the incoming projectiles; opposite of _soft cover_

  - examples: concrete wall, stationary ballistic shield, armored car
